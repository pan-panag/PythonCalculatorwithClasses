        -Memory is single value. <MS> is memory set, <MR> is memory recall and <MC> is memory clear.
        -Backspace deletes the last character on the screen. May break functions.

**NOTICES**
-Most functions open a parenthesis automatically. Those need to be closed by the user.
-The Calculator works with rounding at 10 digits.
-The file with all the code is included in the .zip folder, named "calculator.py". The file calc_icon.ico is required to run.
-The program is not optimised to handle very large numbers. Trying to perform calculations with large digits may result in unexpected errors.
